				About the Legend
			</h1>

			

<p>
				☛ Swami Vivekananda was a Bengali born on 12 January
                 1863.His real name was Narendranath Datta.<br><br>
                ☛ In December 1886, the mother of Baburam 
                invited Narendra and his other brother monks to Antpur village. 
                Narendra and the other aspiring monks accepted the invitation and went
                 to Antpur to spend a few days. In Antpur, on the Christmas Eve of 1886, 
                 Narendra and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows.
                 They decided to live their lives as their master lived.
                  Narendranath took the name "Swami Vivekananda".<br><br>
				☛ He was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious 
                teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.<br><br>
				☛  He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga
                 to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, 
                 and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.<br><br>
				☛ Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament
                 of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words, 
                 "Sisters and brothers of America...," before introducing Hinduism to Americans. 
				
				<br><br> ☛ After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years,
                 Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States,
                  England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, 
                  and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco 
				<br><br> ☛ Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta,
                 Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. 
                 He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk.
				<br><br> ☛ After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively
                 toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions
                  of Indian people in then British India.
				<br><br> Despite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for
                 a second time in June accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. 
                 Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit,
                  Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a 
                  shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California.
				
				<br><br>☛ On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death),
                 Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for
                  three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy 
                  of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned 
                  Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room,
                   asking not to be disturbed;[167] he died at 9:20 p.m.
				<br><br> ☛ Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo-Vedanta, 
                a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line 
                with western esoteric traditions, especially Transcendentalism, 
                New Thought and Theosophy.
